# LSTM-Solar-Production-ERCOT
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict aggregate solar energy production throughout Texas's ERCOT grid.

Texas is of particular interest for the following reasons: 

It has extreme solar irradiance
It contains the majority of utility-scale solar installations
It experiences the most significant transmission constraints
It has the most pronounced price effects due to renewable generation
